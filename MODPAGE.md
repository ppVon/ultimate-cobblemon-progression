# Ultimate Cobblemon Progression

**Ultimate Cobblemon Progression (UCP)** completely overhauls how progression works in Cobblemon — adding trainer levels, tiered Pokémon unlocks, and dynamic spawn scaling based on your progress.

This mod is designed for **server progression, modpacks, and RPG-style playthroughs**, where players gradually earn access to higher-level and rarer Pokémon as they explore and fill out their Pokédex.

Cobblemon Versions:
- Cobblemon 1.6.1: ucp-1.2.2
- Cobblemon 1.7.0: ucp-1.3.0

## Features

* **Trainer Tier System** — Unlock new Pokémon species and raise your level cap as you progress.
* **Level & Weight Scaling** — Wild Pokémon levels and spawn chances scale with your tier.
* **Dex-Based Progression** — Advancement is tied to your Pokédex: see and catch Pokémon to rank up.
* **Full Config Support** — Fine-tune features and spawn levels in the configs
* **Datapack Integration** — Define your own tiers, unlock conditions, and available species per tier.

## Configuration

All gameplay rules are fully configurable via generated JSON files.
See the full configuration reference here:

**[Configuration Wiki Page](https://github.com/ppVon/ultimate-cobblemon-progression/wiki/Configuration)**

## Datapack Integration

Progression tiers are defined through standard datapack JSONs — meaning you can build entirely custom progression paths for your server or modpack.
